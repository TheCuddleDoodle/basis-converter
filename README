# Basis Converter
An online converter for WebGL developers.

This is a Basis format conversion tool for WebGL developers. It is cross-platform and 
installation-free, and everything happens on your computer, without any "cloud services".

The core code logic is taken from [Basis Universal's code repository](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/tree/master/webgl), 
we refactored original code into TypeScript for better development experience.
